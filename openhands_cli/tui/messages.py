"""Message definitions for TUI inter-widget communication.

This module defines the messages that flow between widgets following
Textual's message bubbling pattern. Messages bubble up the DOM tree
from child to parent, allowing ancestor widgets to handle them.

Message Flow:
    InputField
        ↓
    MainDisplay(#main_display)  ← Handles UserInputSubmitted (renders message)
                                ← Handles SlashCommandSubmitted (posts domain messages)
        ↓
    ConversationView            ← Handles NewConversationRequested
        ↓
    OpenHandsApp                ← Handles app-level concerns (modals, notifications)
