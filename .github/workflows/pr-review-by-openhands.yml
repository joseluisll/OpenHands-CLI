    # Use pull_request_target to allow fork PRs to access secrets when triggered by maintainers
    # Security: This workflow runs when:
    #   1. A new PR is opened (non-draft), OR
    #   2. A draft PR is marked as ready for review, OR
    #   3. A maintainer adds the 'review-this' label, OR
    #   4. A maintainer requests openhands-agent or all-hands-bot as a reviewer
    # Only users with write access can add labels or request reviews, ensuring security.
    # The PR code is explicitly checked out for review, but secrets are only accessible
    # because the workflow runs in the base repository context
